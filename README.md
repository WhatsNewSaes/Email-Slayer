# Sparkplug Framework

Sparkplug aims to help front-end developers approach building sites from a modular, scallable approach. 

The file structure is set up to help you deliberately build modular, isolated systems.

Inspiration from:

## 1. Install global dependancies (one time installation)

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `[sudo] npm install bower -g`
  * [grunt.js](http://grunt.js); `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`

## 2. Install local dependancies (for each new instance of sparkplug)

  * Download Zip
  * cd to project folder
  * run `[sudo] npm install` (first time users)
  * run `grunt` (to clean out any old files, compile less, move all required assets to the build folder, spin up a local server that refreshes while watching all files for changes)

Next time you come into the project, just cd to the correct folder and run `grunt` from the terminal
