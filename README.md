# Email Slayer

 Email Slayer makes building responsive emails easy and *extremely* efficient. Here's How:
* It's built off of [Zurb Ink's](http://zurb.com/ink/) framework for responsive emails.
* It's written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) because...it's 2015.
* It brings all your CSS inline with a simple command.
* It even brings your media queires into the `<head>` of your file.

### Global Dependencies (one time installation)

  * Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (If you haven't already)
  * Install Gulp globally [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) `$ npm install gulp -g` (If you haven't already)
  * *(Optional) Email Slayer can also be downloaded through [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower)*  `$ npm install -g bower` to install bower globally

### Getting started | [Demo video](https://youtu.be/2w28l0d-TQM)
