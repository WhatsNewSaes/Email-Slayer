While we try our best to maintain feature parity with [libsass], we can not enable features that have not been implemented in [libsass] yet.\n\nIf you'd like to see what features are still upcoming in [libsass], [Jo Liss](http://twitter.com/jo_liss) has written [a blog post on the subject](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/state-of-libsass/).\n\nPlease check for [issues on the libsass repo](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues) (as there is a good chance that it may already be an issue there for it), and otherwise [create a new issue there](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues/new).\n\nIf this project is missing an API or command line flag that has been added to [libsass], then please open an issue here. We will then look at updating our [libsass] submodule and create a new release. You can help us create the new release by rebuilding binaries, and then creating a pull request to the [node-sass-binaries](https://github.com/sass/node-sass-binaries) repo.\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install node-sass\n\nSome users have reported issues installing on Ubuntu due to `node` being registered to another package. [Follow the official NodeJS docs](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) to install NodeJS so that `#!/usr/bin/env node` correctly resolved.\n\nCompiling versions 0.9.4 and above on Windows machines requires [Visual Studio 2013 WD](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop). If you have multiple VS versions, use ```npm install``` with the ```--msvs_version=2013``` flag also use this flag when rebuilding the module with node-gyp or nw-gyp.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar sass = require('node-sass');\nsass.render({\n\tfile: scss_filename,\n\tsuccess: callback\n\t[, options..]\n\t});\n// OR\nvar result = sass.renderSync({\n\tdata: scss_content\n\t[, options..]\n});\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe API for using node-sass has changed, so that now there is only one variable - an options hash. Some of these options are optional, and in some circumstances some are mandatory.\n\n#### file\n`file` is a `String` of the path to an `scss` file for [libsass] to render. One of this or `data` options are required, for both render and renderSync.\n\n#### data\n`data` is a `String` containing the scss to be rendered by [libsass]. One of this or `file` options are required, for both render and renderSync. It is recommended that you use the `includePaths` option in conjunction with this, as otherwise [libsass] may have trouble finding files imported via the `@import` directive.\n\n#### success\n`success` is a `Function` to be called upon successful rendering of the scss to css. This option is required but only for the render function. If provided to renderSync it will be ignored.\n\nThe callback function is passed a results object, containing the following keys:\n\n* `css` - The compiled CSS. Write this to a file, or serve it out as needed.\n* `map` - The source map\n* `stats` - An object containing information about the compile. It contains the following keys:\n    * `entry` - The path to the scss file, or `data` if the source was not a file\n    * `start` - Date.now() before the compilation\n    * `end` - Date.now() after the compilation\n    * `duration` - *end* - *start*\n    * `includedFiles` - Absolute paths to all related scss files in no particular order.\n\n#### error\n`error` is a `Function` to be called upon occurrence of an error when rendering the scss to css. This option is optional, and only applies to the render function. If provided to renderSync it will be ignored.\n\n#### importer (starting from v2)\n`importer` is a `Function` to be called when libsass parser encounters the import directive. If present, libsass will call node-sass and let the user change file, data or both during the compilation. This option is optional, and applies to both render and renderSync functions. Also, it can either return object of form `{file:'..', contents: '..'}` or send it back via `done({})`. Note in renderSync or render, there is no restriction imposed on using `done()` callback or `return` statement (dispite of the asnchrony difference).\n\n#### includePaths\n`includePaths` is an `Array` of path `String`s to look for any `@import`ed files. It is recommended that you use this option if you are using the `data` option and have **any** `@import` directives, as otherwise [libsass] may not find your depended-on files.\n\n#### imagePath\n`imagePath` is a `String` that represents the public image path. When using the `image-url()` function in a stylesheet, this path will be prepended to the path you supply. eg. Given an `imagePath` of `/path/to/images`, `background-image: image-url('image.png')` will compile to `background-image: url(\"/path/to/images/image.png\")`\n\n#### indentedSyntax\n`indentedSyntax` is a `Boolean` flag to determine if [Sass Indented Syntax](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html) should be used to parse provided string or a file.\n\n#### omitSourceMapUrl\n`omitSourceMapUrl` is a `Boolean` flag to determine whether to include `sourceMappingURL` comment in the output file.\n\n#### outFile\n`outFile` specifies where the CSS will be saved. This option does not actually output a file, but is used as input for generating a source map.\n\n#### outputStyle\n`outputStyle` is a `String` to determine how the final CSS should be rendered. Its value should be one of `'nested'` or `'compressed'`.  Node-sass defaults to 'nested'.\n[`'expanded'` and `'compact'` are not currently supported by [libsass]]\n\n#### precision\n`precision` is a `Number` that will be used to determine how many digits after the decimal will be allowed. For instance, if you had a decimal number of `1.23456789` and a precision of `5`, the result will be `1.23457` in the final CSS.\n\n#### sourceComments\n`sourceComments` is a `Boolean` flag to determine what debug information is included in the output file.\n\n#### sourceMap\nYou must define this option as well as `outFile` in order to generate a source map. If it is set to `true`, the source map will be generated at the path provided in the `outFile` option. If set to a path (`String`), the source map will be generated at the provided path.\n\n#### sourceMapEmbed\n`sourceMapEmbed` is a `Boolean` flag to determine whether to embed `sourceMappingUrl` as data URI.\n\n#### sourceMapContents\n`sourceMapContents` is a `Boolean` flag to determine whether to include `contents` in maps.\n\n### Examples\n\n```javascript\nvar sass = require('node-sass');\nsass.render({\n\tfile: '/path/to/myFile.scss',\n\tdata: 'body{background:blue; a{color:black;}}',\n\tsuccess: function(result) {\n\t\t// result is an object: v2 change\n        console.log(result.css);\n        console.log(result.stats);\n        console.log(result.map)\n\t},\n\terror: function(error) {\n\t\t// error is an object: v2 change\n\t\tconsole.log(error.message);\n\t\tconsole.log(error.code);\n\t\tconsole.log(error.line);\n\t\tconsole.log(error.column); // new in v2\n\t},\n\timporter: function(url, prev, done) {\n\t\t// url is the path in import as is, which libsass encountered.\n\t\t// prev is the previously resolved path.\n\t\t// done is an optional callback, either consume it or return value synchronously.\n\t\tsomeAsyncFunction(url, prev, function(result){\n\t\t\tdone({\n\t\t\t\tfile: result.path, // only one of them is required, see section Sepcial Behaviours.\n\t\t\t\tcontents: result.data\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t});\n\t\t// OR\n\t\tvar result = someSyncFunction(url, prev);\n\t\treturn {file: result.path, contents: result.data};\n\t},\n\tincludePaths: [ 'lib/', 'mod/' ],\n\toutputStyle: 'compressed'\n});\n// OR\nvar result = sass.renderSync({\n\tfile: '/path/to/file.scss',\n\tdata: 'body{background:blue; a{color:black;}}',\n\toutputStyle: 'compressed',\n\toutFile: '/to/my/output.css',\n\tsourceMap: true, // or an absolute or relative (to outFile) path\n\timporter: function(url, prev, done) {\n\t\t// url is the path in import as is, which libsass encountered.\n\t\t// prev is the previously resolved path.\n\t\t// done is an optional callback, either consume it or return value synchronously.\n\t\tsomeAsyncFunction(url, prev, function(result){\n\t\t\tdone({\n\t\t\t\tfile: result.path, // only one of them is required, see section Sepcial Behaviours.\n\t\t\t\tcontents: result.data\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t});\n\t\t// OR\n\t\tvar result = someSyncFunction(url, prev);\n\t\treturn {file: result.path, contents: result.data};\n\t},\n}));\n\nconsole.log(result.css);\nconsole.log(result.map);\nconsole.log(result.stats);\n```\n\n### Special behaviours\n\n* In the case that both `file` and `data` options are set, node-sass will give precedence to `data` and use `file` to calculate paths in sourcemaps.\n\n### Version information (v2 change)\n\nBoth `node-sass` and `libsass` version info is now present in `package.json` and is exposed via `info()` method:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('node-sass').info();\n\n// outputs something like:\n// node-sass version: 2.0.0-beta\n// libsass version: 3.1.0-beta\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nListing of community uses of node-sass in build tools and frameworks.\n\n### Brackets extension\n\n[@jasonsanjose](https://github.com/jasonsanjose) has created a [Brackets](http://brackets.io) extension based on node-sass: <https://github.com/jasonsanjose/brackets-sass>. When editing Sass files, the extension compiles changes on save. The extension also integrates with Live Preview to show Sass changes in the browser without saving or compiling.\n\n### Brunch plugin\n\n[Brunch](http://brunch.io)'s official sass plugin uses node-sass by default, and automatically falls back to ruby if use of Compass is detected: <https://github.com/brunch/sass-brunch>\n\n### Connect/Express middleware\n\nRecompile `.scss` files automatically for connect and express based http servers.\n\nThis functionality has been moved to [`node-sass-middleware`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass-middleware) in node-sass v1.0.0\n\n### DocPad Plugin\n\n[@jking90](https://github.com/jking90) wrote a [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) plugin that compiles `.scss` files using node-sass: <https://github.com/jking90/docpad-plugin-nodesass>\n\n### Duo.js extension\n\n[@stephenway](https://github.com/stephenway) has created an extension that transpiles Sass to CSS using node-sass with [duo.js](http://duojs.org/)\n<https://github.com/duojs/sass>\n\n### Grunt extension\n\n[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/) has created a set of grunt tasks based on node-sass: <https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass>\n\n### Gulp extension\n\n[@dlmanning](https://github.com/dlmanning/) has created a gulp sass plugin based on node-sass: <https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass>\n\n### Harp\n\n[@sintaxi](https://github.com/sintaxi)’s Harp web server implicitly compiles `.scss` files using node-sass: <https://github.com/sintaxi/harp>\n\n### Metalsmith plugin\n\n[@stevenschobert](https://github.com/stevenschobert/) has created a metalsmith plugin based on node-sass: <https://github.com/stevenschobert/metalsmith-sass>\n\n### Meteor plugin\n\n[@fourseven](https://github.com/fourseven) has created a meteor plugin based on node-sass: <https://github.com/fourseven/meteor-scss>\n\n### Mimosa module\n\n[@dbashford](https://github.com/dbashford) has created a Mimosa module for sass which includes node-sass: <https://github.com/dbashford/mimosa-sass>\n\n## Example App\n\nThere is also an example connect app here: <https://github.com/andrew/node-sass-example>\n\n## Rebuilding binaries\n\nNode-sass includes pre-compiled binaries for popular platforms, to add a binary for your platform follow these steps:\n\nCheck out the project:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/sass/node-sass.git\ncd node-sass\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nnpm install\nnpm install -g node-gyp\nnode-gyp rebuild  # to make debug release, use -d switch\n```\n\n### Workaround for node `v0.11.13` `v0.11.14`\nFollow the steps above, but comment out this [line](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/blob/e01497c4d4b8a7a7f4dbf9d607920ac10ad64445/lib/index.js#L181) in `lib/index.js` before the `npm install` step. Then uncomment it back again, and continue with the rest of the steps (see issue [#563](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/563)).\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nThe interface for command-line usage is fairly simplistic at this stage, as seen in the following usage section.\n\nOutput will be saved with the same name as input SASS file into the current working directory if it's omitted.\n\n### Usage\n `node-sass [options] <input.scss> [<output.css>]`\n\n **Options:**\n\n```bash\n    -w, --watch                Watch a directory or file\n    -r, --recursive            Recursively watch directories or files\n    -o, --output               Output directory\n    -x, --omit-source-map-url  Omit source map URL comment from output\n    -i, --indented-syntax      Treat data from stdin as sass code (versus scss)\n    --output-style             CSS output style (nested|expanded|compact|compressed)\n    --source-comments          Include debug info in output\n    --source-map               Emit source map\n    --source-map-embed         Embed sourceMappingUrl as data URI\n    --source-map-contents      Embed include contents in map\n    --include-path             Path to look for imported files\n    --image-path               Path to prepend when using the `image-url()` helper\n    --precision                The amount of precision allowed in decimal numbers\n    --stdout                   Print the resulting CSS to stdout\n    --importer                 Path to custom importer\n    --help                     Print usage info\n```\n\nNote `--importer` takes the (absolute or relative to pwd) path to a js file, which needs to have a default `module.exports` set to the importer function. See our test [fixtures](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/tree/974f93e76ddd08ea850e3e663cfe64bb6a059dd3/test/fixtures/extras) for example.\n\n## Post-install Build\n\nInstall runs only two Mocha tests to see if your machine can use the pre-built [libsass] which will save some time during install. If any tests fail it will build from source.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis module is brought to you and maintained by the following people:\n\n* Adeel Mujahid - Project Lead ([Github](https://github.com/am11) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adeelbm))\n* Andrew Nesbitt ([Github](https://github.com/andrew) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teabass))\n* Dean Mao ([Github](https://github.com/deanmao) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deanmao))\n* Brett Wilkins ([Github](https://github.com/bwilkins) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bjmaz))\n* Keith Cirkel ([Github](https://github.com/keithamus) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Keithamus))\n* Laurent Goderre ([Github](https://github.com/laurentgoderre) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurentgoderre))\n* Nick Schonning ([Github](https://github.com/nschonni) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nschonni))\n* Adam Yeats ([Github](https://github.com/adamyeats) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamyeats))\n\n## Contributors\n\nWe <3 our contributors!
