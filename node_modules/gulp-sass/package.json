  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dlmanning/gulp-sass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dlmanning/gulp-sass)\n\ngulp-sass\n=========\n\nSass plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).\n\n#Install\n\n```\nnpm install gulp-sass\n```\n\n#Basic Usage\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar sass = require('gulp-sass');\n\ngulp.task('sass', function () {\n\tgulp.src('./scss/*.scss')\n\t\t.pipe(sass())\n\t\t.pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));\n});\n```\n\nOptions passed as a hash into `sass()` will be passed along to [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).\n\nIf you want to use the indented syntax (`.sass`) as the top level file, use `sass({indentedSyntax: true})`.\n\n## gulp-sass specific options\n\n#### `errLogToConsole: true`\n\nIf you pass `errLogToConsole: true` into the options hash, sass errors will be logged to the console instead of generating a `gutil.PluginError` object. Use this option with `gulp.watch` to keep gulp from stopping every time you mess up your sass.\n\n#### `onSuccess: callback`\n\nPass in your own callback to be called upon successful compilation by node-sass. The callback has the form `callback(css)`, and is passed the compiled css as a string. Note: This *does not* prevent gulp-sass's default behavior of writing the output css file.\n\n#### `onError: callback`\n\nPass in your own callback to be called upon a sass error from node-sass. The callback has the form `callback(err)`, where err is the error string generated by libsass. Note: this *does* prevent an actual `gulpPluginError` object from being created.\n\n#### `sync: true`\n\nIf you pass `sync: true` into the options hash, sass.renderSync will be called, instead of sass.render. This should help when memory and/or cpu usage is getting very high when rendering many and/or big files.\n\n## Source Maps\n\ngulp-sass can be used in tandem with [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) to generate source maps for the SASS to CSS compilation. You will need to initialize [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) prior to running the gulp-sass compiler and write the source maps after.\n\n```javascript\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\ngulp.src('./scss/*.scss')\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n    .pipe(sass())\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.write())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./css');\n\n// will write the source maps inline in the compiled CSS files\n```\n\nBy default, [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) writes the source maps inline in the compiled CSS files. To write them to a separate file, specify a relative file path in the `sourcemaps.write()` function.\n\n```javascript\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\ngulp.src('./scss/*.scss')\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n    .pipe(sass())\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.write('./maps'))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));\n\n// will write the source maps to ./dest/css/maps\n```\n\n#Imports and Partials\n\ngulp-sass now automatically passes along the directory of every scss file it parses as an include path for node-sass. This means that as long as you specify your includes relative to path of your scss file, everything will just work.\n\nscss/includes/_settings.scss:\n\n```scss\n$blue: #3bbfce;\n$margin: 16px;\n```\n\nscss/style.scss:\n\n```scss\n@import \"includes/settings\";\n\n.content-navigation {\n  border-color: $blue;\n  color:\n    darken($blue, 9%);\n}\n\n.border {\n  padding: $margin / 2;\n  margin: $margin / 2;\n  border-color: $blue;\n}\n```\n\n#Issues\n\nBefore submitting an issue, please understand that gulp-sass is only a wrapper for [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass), which in turn is a node front end for [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass). Missing sass features and errors should not be reported here.\n",
